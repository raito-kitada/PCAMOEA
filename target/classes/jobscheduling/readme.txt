Optimization for Job Scheduling Problem (JSP)

resource : data file for JSP
  ProbabilityDistribution_small.csv : Probability distribution of the number of nodes and request time 
                                      which made from the job history of "K" supercomputer's small resource group.

trial2020 : First version of multiobjective optimization of super computer job scheduling problem 
            using evolutionary computation.

trial2020v2 : Second version of multiobjective optimization of super computer job scheduling problem 
              using evolutionary computation.
              
              In this version, it is possible to conduct optimization multiple times. 
              This program can optimize jobs arriving at a certain time and also repeat it.
